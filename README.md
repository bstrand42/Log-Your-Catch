# Log Your Catch

## Ethos

The fisheries of Eastern Seaboard are a precious resource. Management teams are often required to set catch limits and take other regulatory actions with limited data.

This app allows anyone to log the size and species of their catch, collecting critical data to encourage informed management decisions.

## Features

* It is possible to note weather the fish was kept or released
* Coordinates are optionally recorded for each fish
* Records are cached locally on the device if fish are caught far from cell towers.
